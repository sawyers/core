## 1 Containerization with k8s

- Features
  - Open source for all sizes to automating service lifecycle from deploy to management
  - Multi-host container scheduling, done by kube-scheduler to assing pods as needed
  - The Pods can be horizontally scaled via an API. Flexibility and Modularization. Kubernetes has a plug-and-play architecture
  - There are specific add-ons for network drivers, service discovery, container runtime, visualization, and command.
  - Two features that allow Kubernetes Clusters to scale are Registration and Discovery
  - Application upgrades are supported out of the box, as well as application rollbacks
  - Secrets are mounted as data volumes or environment variables, and they are also specific to a single namespace.

## 2 Terminology

- master node has API server, scheduler, controller mgr (node controller, replication, endpoints, service act & tokens, etcd [cluster db] for jobs, status, etc)
  - interacted with by kubectl
- work nodes via kubelet to run pods, manage nodes, etc. Works with docker in most cases. Also uses kube-proxy
- Docker on nodes runs containers called pods and they are the smallest unit. Kubelet manages and routes work on the node between pods and the proxy handles internet access if needed.

### Nodes and pods

- Master controlls the cluster built of nodes
- a node can be physical or virtual and must have kubelet, container mgt, kube-proxy and supervisord
- have at least 3 nodes for production
- minikube for local dev
- Pods is the simplest unit, you can crud pods and is a running process
- Each pod has the docker application container, storage, IP and options of how the containers should run. A pod may be multiple docker containers (eg. service + health) but are the smallest unit of deployment, a single instance of an app.
- Pods are designed to be ephemeral, disposable entities.
- If a pod dies it doesn't get rescheduled
- a pod can be run on its own for dev/test but will lack a contr----- Updated Jul 2, 2019 9:30:47 AM -----oller, so if it dies or exits it will not restart.  The controllers add management concepts to pods.
- States: Pending, Running, Succeeded, Failed, CrashLoopBackOff (failed to start and k8s is looping attempts to restart the pod.)

### Deployments

- Controllers provide app reliability, scaling, load balancing
  - ReplicaSet - ensure pods are running at all times at defined number of pods and is part of a deployment
  - describes updates of pods and ReplicaSets
  - Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> pod; allows easy rollback on failed update
    - Pod management via ReplicaSet to deploy / monitor pods as a single unit
    - Scaling ReplicaSet to handle load balancing / scale up or down
    - Pause / resume of a deployment for larger change sets; only pauses the update, not the service
    - Status / health
  - Replication (replaced by deployments)
  - DaemonSets - version control of pods
    - Job control, state of the job, unique run of processes
    - Services of network connectivity between deployments
    - Allows pod sets to communicate (internal / external public endpoints) AKA NodePort
    - Load Balancers
  - Labels are key/value to organize and are unique per
    - release: state
    - env: dev/qa
    - tier: front/back
  - Selectors are set based or equality based
    - used to list and filter objects
  - namespaces allow access to teams with accountability or divide clusters between users and scope for names (unique in a namespace)

### Kubelet and proxy

- kubelet talks to the controller via API, executes pods via container engine, mounts volumes and manages secrets and runs pod health checking
- Runs via podspec (yaml) kubelet manages pods based on the spec but does not manage pods started by hand (see above). Only pods created via the API server are managed.
- Can be managed by REST, but is rare
- Proxy manages processes that run on the nodes, manages services defined for each node including round-robin load balancing and manage service cluster IP's / ports
- User space, iptables, ipvs modes, user space is most common.
- Services are defined against API server, proxy monitors the api for changes
- proxy opens random port on the local node for each service and connections made the the port are proxied to one of the corresponding back-end pods

### Health check

in the cluster you can define readiness and liveliness checks for each service.  Thing like checking for a service started or a response from a web server might be common.

each probe can set a wait time and number of retries before it is considered failed.  A failure in readyness will prevent the deploy from being ready while a liveliness probe will trigger restarts of the container to try and get it healthy.

### Service updates
